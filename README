# AI Skill Project

This project uses OpenAI's API and related agent libraries to build AI-powered applications. It includes Python dependencies for OpenAI, agent chat, and data processing.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ai-skill
```

### 2. Install dependencies
It is recommended to use a virtual environment (e.g., Conda or venv).

#### Using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Using Conda:
```bash
conda create -n ai-skill python=3.10
conda activate ai-skill
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Get an OpenAI API Key
1. Go to [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
2. Log in or sign up for an OpenAI account.
3. Click "Create new secret key" and copy the generated key.

### 4. Set your API key in the `.env` file
Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory and add:
```
API_KEY=sk-...
```
Replace `sk-...` with your actual OpenAI API key.

### 5. Test your setup
You can use the provided `setup.ipynb` notebook to verify your API key and environment.

## Usage
- Run Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to interact with OpenAI models and agents.
- See `setup.ipynb` for example usage and API key validation.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter authentication errors, double-check your API key in the `.env` file.
- Ensure all dependencies are installed and your environment is activated.
